In this section i'm going to show some usefull example of Python code's

From simple to more complex codes

## Examples
* E1
a program that reads a three-digit number from the input and prints it twice in reverse.
You can make sure that the input is a three-digit number.
For example, if the input was 532, print at the output of 235 * 2, 470.

* E2
In this program read a positive number of inputs and determine whether this number is prime or not.
The definition of the prim number: apart from one and to itself, is not divisible by any other number.
