# Summary 
*A sequential search is O(n) for ordered and unordered lists.
*A binary search of an ordered list is O(logn) in the worst case.
*Hash tables can provide constant time searching.
*A bubble sort, a selection sort, and an insertion sort are O(n2) algorithms.
*A shell sort improves on the insertion sort by sorting incremental sublists. It falls between O(n) and O(n2).
*A merge sort is O(nlogn), but requires additional space for the merging process.
*A quick sort is O(nlogn), but may degrade to O(n2) if the split points are not near the middle of the list. It does not require additional space.
