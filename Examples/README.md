In this section i'm going to show some usefull example of Python code's

From simple to more complex codes

## Examples

* E1
a program that reads a three-digit number from the input and prints it twice in reverse.
You can make sure that the input is a three-digit number.
For example, if the input was 532, print at the output of 235 * 2, 470.

* E2
In this program read a positive number of inputs and determine whether this number is prime or not.
The definition of the prim number: apart from one and to itself, is not divisible by any other number.

* E3
A program that recalled the age of the candidates from the input and the age of the largest and the second largest on the output.
this program will continue to read from the input as long as the negative number of one is not entered.


* E4
A program that reads 20 entries and at the end prints the number that has the largest number of divisors in the output.
If they had a few numbers, they would print the largest of them

* E5
A program that reads a string from the input and makes the following changes in it.

1 - Clear all the vowels.

2 - Before each silent letter, print a point.

3 - Write down all the silent letters that are left.

(Vowels are aeiou)

* E6
a program that reads 10 name's from the input and outputs their standardized form.
(the standard means exactly the first letter of the name should be Uppercase, and the rest of the letters are lowercase)

* E7
A program that determines whether the input word is palindrome or not.
a palindrome word is word that can be read from left or right and be the same.
